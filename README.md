### Task 1: Speed Control

Implement the ability to increase and decrease the speed of the t-rex by using the left and right arrows ‚Üê ‚Üí.


Definitions of Done:

- You can increase the speed of the t-rex by pressing the right arrow (‚Üí) and decrease the speed by pressing the left arrow (‚Üê).

Hints:
- You can find and add the key press definitions in [/src/runner.ts (L106)](/src/runner.ts#L106)
- Do not confuse the `KEYDOWN` event and `onKeyDown` function with pressing the down arrow key ‚Üì. It **does not** refer to the down arrow key, but to the event of any key being pressed down!

### Task 2: Life System

Implement a system where the T-Rex has three lives, allowing it to continue after hitting obstacles as long as there is at least one life left. Display the life counter as a number next to the distance meter (top right corner).

Definitions of Done:

- Game starts with 3 lives, displaying the counter in the top-right corner.
- After a collision with an obstacle deduct 1 life.
- Show the GameOver screen, if no lives (i.e., 0 lives) remain.
- _Hint: After a collision, you might need to set a grace period or move the obstacle, such that the player does not get hit again instantly in the next frame_

### Task 3: Share Achievement

In the GameOver screen, implement the option to share your current run as an image. Add a share button next to the ‚ÄúStart Again‚Äù button, which will ask the user to enter a name, and then trigger the download of the image. The image should contain the user name, achieved distance, and use the last frame as the background image:

Definitions of Done:

- Add a _Share_ button next to the _Restart_ button in the GameOver screen.
- By clicking the _Share_ button, the user is prompted to enter a name.
- After submitting the name, a download of the sharable image is triggered. The image should contain the user name, achieved distance, and use the last frame as the background image.
