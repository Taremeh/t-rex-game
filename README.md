The [extraction.html](./extraction.html) is a **stand-alone** HTML file running T-Rex!

All assets (mp3/png) are encoded into the HTML, which means that only the HTML file is needed to play T-Rex!

All codes and assets are extracted from [source code of Chromium](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/neterror/?q=t-rex+package:%5Echromium$&dr=C) which is released under [BSD](http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html).
