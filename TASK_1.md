# Task 1: Speed Control

Implement the ability to increase and decrease the speed of the t-rex by using the left and right arrows ← →.


Definitions of Done:

- You can increase the speed of the t-rex by pressing the right arrow (→) and decrease the speed by pressing the left arrow (←).

Hints:
- You can find and add the key press definitions in [/src/runner.ts (L53)](/src/runner.ts#L53)
- Do not confuse the `KEYDOWN` event and `onKeyDown` function with pressing the down arrow key ↓. It **does not** refer to the down arrow key, but to the event of any key being pressed down!
